Code Injecter
 ------------------------------
 
 A tool to make changes in the code of a webpage(basically over http server) like injecting a javascript code in it.
 It can also work for the https server using sslstrip and in the code replace port from 80 to 10000 as sslstrip works over port : 10000.
